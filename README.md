A small cube scrambler I made in C#.

# **NOTATION**

_F_ is one 90º clockwise turn on the front side.
_R_ is one 90º clockwise turn on the right side.
_U_ is one 90º clockwise turn on the up side.
_L_ is one 90º clockwise turn on the left side.
_B_ is one 90º clockwise turn on the back side.
_D_ is one 90º clockwise turn on the down (bottom) side.
# **SPECIAL CHARACTERS**

When you put an apostrophe after the notation (U'), that makes it a 90º counter-clockwise turn.
When you put a "2" after the notation (U2), that makes it a 180º clockwise turn (same thing as a 180º counter-clockwise turn).
